Activity Timeline
-----------------
Discuss your project in-depth and add to your current set of Work Packages  
At this stage in the project you should have around 30 !  
Extend your activity timeline to include the new Work Packages.

Spring CRUD
-----------
If your project involves a Spring server and database, it's time to set one up:
- Design an initial schema
- Create the database in your chosen DBMS
- Create the required tables
- Populate your tables with sample data
- Allocate members of your team the job of writing Java code that interogates the DB

Make sure you create suitable Work Packages in Open Project to reflect this work allocation !
