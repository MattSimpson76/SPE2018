Stakeholders
------------
Identify as _comprehensive_ a list of stakeholders as possible for Open Project.  
Include a brief explanatory description for each.


Functional Requirements
-----------------------
Identify 5 functional (feature) requirements for Open Project.  
Include a brief explanatory description for each.

For each requirement, ask yourself the question: are they atomic ?  
(can they be broken down into a number of simpler requirements)


Non-functional Requirements
---------------------------
Identify 5 non-functional requirements that constrain the operation of Open Project.

Be sure to think broadly about the different types of constraint.  
Don't just repeat similar ones for different aspects of the system !

For each requirement, ask yourself the question: is it verifiable ?  
(can we check conclusively that each requirement has been fulfilled).


Completeness
------------
Completeness is a key feature of any requirements documentation.

We appreciate that you have only had limited time to identify the above requirements.  
But it is worth revisiting your original set of stakeholders and asking the question:  
_Have you overlooked the needs of certain key people in your analysis ?_
